# 4501_project
## Project Description
This project primarily focus on the yellow taxi and uber trips records from 2009-01 to 2015-06 and make analysis with the weather records on precipitation and wind speed in the New York City region. It includes one Jupyter notebook and SQL queries. We clean the taxi, uber and weather data, store them in a SQLite database, and provide visualizations. We are interested in investigating the peak hours or most popular days of the week for taxi and uber trips, and also the relationships of hired trips with weather records on special weather occassion such as hurricane. We also discover the windest days and hottest days during specific period by querying the dataset. At the end, we make six graphs which clearly represent the relationships among location, weather and the number of hired trips.
